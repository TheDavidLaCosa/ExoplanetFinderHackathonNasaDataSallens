## 🎓 For Presentations

### 30-Second Version
"We built NASA DataPilot, an AI-powered platform that makes NASA data accessible to everyone. It combines a ChatGPT-style interface with an interactive neural network trainer, allowing users to analyze exoplanet data and train ML models without writing code."

### 2-Minute Version
"NASA DataPilot is your AI copilot for space data analysis. The platform features three main components: First, an AI chat interface that helps users understand NASA datasets and detection methods. Second, an interactive neural network playground where users can train models on real Kepler and TESS exoplanet data. And third, a comprehensive data browser and knowledge base. 

While currently focused on exoplanet classification—analyzing transit depths, orbital periods, and stellar properties—the architecture is designed to support any NASA dataset. Users can explore over 5,500 confirmed exoplanets, adjust neural network architectures, tune hyperparameters, and visualize decision boundaries in real-time. All using data from NASA's official Exoplanet Archive.

The name 'DataPilot' reflects our vision: an AI assistant that pilots users through the vast universe of NASA data, making space science accessible and engaging for researchers, students, and enthusiasts alike."
