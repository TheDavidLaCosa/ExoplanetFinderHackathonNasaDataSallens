# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Your app is READY! Here's what to do:

### 1️⃣ Open the App
Your React app is already running at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2️⃣ Refresh Your Browser
Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) to see the updated design

### 3️⃣ Load Real NASA Data
1. Look at the **DATA** section on the left
2. Select a dataset (Kepler, TESS, etc.)
3. Click the blue **"Load NASA Data"** button
4. Wait a few seconds while it fetches real exoplanet data
5. See the statistics appear showing how many exoplanets were loaded!

### 4️⃣ Train Your Neural Network
1. Click the **Play** button (▶️) at the top
2. Watch the epoch counter increase
3. See the loss values decrease
4. Watch the visualization update in real-time!

### 5️⃣ Experiment!
- **Add/remove hidden layers** with the +/- buttons
- **Adjust learning rate** to see how it affects training
- **Try different datasets** (Kepler has 2,700+ exoplanets!)
- **Change activation functions** (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid)
- **Add regularization** to prevent overfitting
