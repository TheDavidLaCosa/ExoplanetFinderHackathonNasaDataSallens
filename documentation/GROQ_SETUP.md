# üöÄ Groq AI Integration Setup

## What is Groq?

Groq provides ultra-fast AI inference with their LPU‚Ñ¢ technology. We're using their API to power the AI chat in NASA DataPilot with real-time, intelligent responses about NASA data and space science.

**Model:** Llama 3.3 70B Versatile (fast and powerful)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Your App

### Step 1: Create .env File

In the project root, create a file named `.env`:

```bash
cd /Users/uzzielperez/Desktop/NASA/exoplanet-playground
touch .env
```

### Step 2: Add Your API Key

Open `.env` and add:

```
REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Important:** Replace `gsk_your_actual_api_key_here` with your real Groq API key!

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

---

## ‚úÖ Test It!

1. **Open the app** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Type a question** like "What is an exoplanet?"
3. **Watch the AI respond** with real intelligence powered by Groq!

If you see a warning about API key not configured, double-check your `.env` file.

## üéØ What the AI Can Do

The AI is trained to help with:

### Exoplanet Science
- Explain what exoplanets are
- Describe detection methods (transit, radial velocity, etc.)
- Provide info about specific exoplanets
- Discuss habitability and the Goldilocks zone

### NASA Missions
- Kepler Space Telescope
- TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)
- James Webb Space Telescope
- Hubble and other missions

### Data Analysis
- How to use the Dashboard
- Training neural networks
- Understanding datasets
- Machine learning basics

### General Space Science
- Solar system
- Stars and galaxies
- Space exploration history
- Future missions

---

## üîí Security Notes

### For Development
- `.env` file is NOT committed to git (listed in `.gitignore`)
- API key stays on your local machine
- Safe for testing and demos

### For Production (if deploying)
- Use environment variables in your hosting platform
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Consider using secret management services
- Monitor API usage

---

## üí° Features

### Smart Responses
The AI understands context and provides relevant answers about:
- NASA data and missions
- Space science concepts
- How to use the Dashboard
- Machine learning techniques

### Conversation Memory
The AI remembers the conversation context, so you can ask follow-up questions naturally.

### Fallback System
If the Groq API is unavailable, the app falls back to local canned responses so it never breaks.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured" Warning

**Problem:** App shows warning about missing API key

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify the key starts with `REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=`
3. Make sure you copied the full API key from Groq Console
4. Restart the development server (`npm start`)

### "Network Error" or "Failed to fetch"

**Problem:** Can't connect to Groq API

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API key is valid (not expired/revoked)
3. Check Groq status at https://status.groq.com/
4. Look at browser console for specific error messages

### Slow Responses

**Problem:** AI takes a long time to respond

**Possible causes:**
1. High API usage (rate limiting)
2. Network latency
3. Complex questions requiring more processing

**Note:** Groq is typically very fast (< 1 second)

### App Falls Back to Local Responses

**Problem:** Getting canned responses instead of AI

**This means:**
- Groq API failed for some reason
- App is using fallback system (this is a feature!)
- Check console for error messages

## üéì System Prompt

The AI is given this context:

```
You are NASA DataPilot, an AI assistant specialized in NASA data analysis 
and space science. You help users understand NASA datasets, learn about 
exoplanet detection methods, train neural networks, and explore space 
missions.

Key knowledge areas:
- Exoplanet science and detection methods
- NASA missions (Kepler, TESS, Hubble, JWST, etc.)
- Machine learning for astronomy
- Data analysis techniques
- Space exploration history

Be conversational, educational, and enthusiastic about space science.
```

## üìö Example Conversations

### Example 1: Learning About Exoplanets
```
You: What is an exoplanet?

AI: An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system! 
Since the first confirmed discovery in 1992, we've found over 5,500 of 
them using various detection methods.

The most successful method is the transit method - watching for tiny dips 
in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it. That's how the 
Kepler and TESS missions have discovered thousands of these distant worlds.

Want to explore real exoplanet data? Check out our Dashboard where you can 
train neural networks on actual NASA observations!
```

### Example 2: Technical Questions
```
You: How do I train a neural network on the dashboard?

AI: Great question! Here's how to get started with neural network training:

1. Click the "Dashboard" button below
2. Select a dataset (Kepler, TESS, or All Confirmed)
3. Click "Load NASA Data" to fetch real exoplanet data
4. Configure your network architecture (add/remove layers)
5. Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size
6. Hit the Play button and watch it train in real-time!

You'll see the loss decrease as the network learns to classify exoplanets. 
The visualization shows the decision boundary evolving. It's really cool 
to watch AI learn from real NASA data!
```

## üöÄ Advanced: Streaming Responses

The code includes a streaming function (`chatWithGroqStream`) for real-time token-by-token responses, similar to ChatGPT. To enable:

1. Update `handleSend` function to use `chatWithGroqStream`
2. Add state for streaming text
3. Update UI to show text as it arrives

This creates a more interactive experience but requires more complex state management.

## üìà Monitoring Usage

1. **Visit Groq Console:** https://console.groq.com/
2. **Check "Usage" tab** for:
   - Requests per day
   - Tokens consumed
   - API key activity
3. **Set up alerts** for approaching limits
