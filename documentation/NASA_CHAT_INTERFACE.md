## 🎬 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Learning About Exoplanets
```
You: What is an exoplanet?

AI: An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar 
system. Scientists have discovered over 5,500 confirmed exoplanets 
using methods like the transit method (watching for dimming of stars) 
and radial velocity (detecting stellar wobbles). Our dashboard lets 
you explore real NASA data from missions like Kepler and TESS!
```

### Example 2: Understanding Methods
```
You: How does the transit method work?

AI: The transit method detects exoplanets by measuring the slight 
dimming of a star's light when a planet passes in front of it. This 
is like watching a fly cross in front of a headlight - tiny but 
detectable! The Kepler and TESS missions use this method. You can 
see real transit data in our Dashboard.
```

### Example 3: Training Neural Networks
```
You: How do I train a neural network?

AI: Training a neural network on exoplanet data:

1. Select a dataset (Kepler, TESS, etc.)
2. Choose features (orbital period, transit depth, etc.)
3. Configure your network architecture
4. Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size)
5. Hit Play and watch it learn!

Our Dashboard makes it interactive and visual. Want to try it?
